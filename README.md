This is just a simple fullstack app. It uses React with typescript on client side and expressJS on server side. It also uses react redux toolkit to store data and PostgreSQL as db. Probably will add apollo graphql in the future.

In client folder use script "npm run dev" to start react server, in server folder use script "npm run dev" as well to start expressJS server. And don't forget to run "npm i" in both client and server to install all the dependencies.
